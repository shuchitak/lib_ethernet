XMOS 100Mbit Ethernet application note
======================================

Summary
-------

Ethernet connectivity is an essential part of the explosion of connected
devices known collectively as the Internet of Things (IoT).  XMOS technology is
perfectly suited to these applications - offering future proof and reliable
ethernet connectivity whilst offering the flexibility to interface to a huge
variety of "Things".

This application note shows a simple example that demonstrates the use
of the XMOS Ethernet library to create a layer 2 ethernet MAC
interface on an XMOS multicore microcontroller.

The code associated with this application note provides an example of
using the Ethernet Library to provide a framework for the creation of an
ethernet Media Independent Interface (MII) and MAC interface for
100Mbps.

The applcation note uses XMOS libraries to provide a simple IP stack
capable of responding to an ICMP ping message. The code used in the
application note provides both MII communication to the PHY and a MAC
transport layer for ethernet packets and enables a client to connect
to it and send/receive packets.

Required tools and libraries
............................

For a list of direct dependencies, look for USED_MODULES in the Makefile.

Required hardware
.................

This application note is designed to run on an XMOS xCORE-200
series device.
The example code provided with the application has been implemented
and tested on the X200 sliceKIT 1V0 (XK-SK-X200-ST) core board using
ethernet sliceCARD 1V1 (XA-SK-E100). There is no dependancy on this
core board - it can be modified to run on any (XMOS) development board
which has the option to connect to the ethernet sliceCARD. 

Prerequisites
..............

 * This document assumes familarity with the XMOS xCORE architecture,
   the Ethernet standards IEEE 802.3u (MII), the XMOS tool chain and
   the xC language. Documentation related to these aspects which are
   not specific to this application note are linked to in the
   references appendix.
